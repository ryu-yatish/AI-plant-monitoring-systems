The folders are as follows:
COLOR - Contains a python notebook which uses a rudimentry image segmentation as a mask to calculate averge colour in BGR. Colorsys can be further used to get HSV average which is infact more useful.
	literature folder contains relevant research papers.
	screenshots of some examples.
depth perception - Document has a psuedode algorithm to get the shoot length.
		   literature doc contains relevant reference links for future development .
		   screenshot of disparity calculation.
		   hardware document gives some implementation suggestions. 
leaf count - contains a python notebook which is a yolov3 tutorial with slight changes to more fit this project.
	     literature folder contains relevant research papers.
